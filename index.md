I am Ayan, a Research Scholar pursuing Master of Science (M.S.) in the department of *[Electrical Engineering](http://ee.iitkgp.ac.in/) at Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Kharagpur*. Alongside my masters degree, I am also involved in a project named "MIRIAD" funded by [Intel India Pvt. Ltd](https://www.intel.in/content/www/in/en/homepage.html). My broad area of research is the domain of *Artifical Intelligence (A.I.)*; I am specifically interested in the emerging field of Deep Learning - the theoretical perspective as well as it's efficient practical implementation. I am a hardcore techie with a lot of passion for research. I love to share knowledge, and so, I decided to maintain a tech blog in this website. I am currently a part of [Kharagpur Learning, Imaging and Visualization Research Group](https://iitkliv.github.io/) led by [Prof. Debdoot Sheet](http://www.facweb.iitkgp.ac.in/~debdoot/). I have also been selected as an [Intel Student Ambassador](https://software.intel.com/en-us/ai-academy/ambassadors) for A.I. from IIT Kharagpur.
