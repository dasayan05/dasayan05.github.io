I am Ayan, a research enthusiast pursuing **Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.)** with fully-funded university scholarship in the [Center for Vision, Speech and Signal Processing (CVSSP)](https://www.surrey.ac.uk/centre-vision-speech-signal-processing) at the [Faculty of Engineering and Physical Sciences](https://www.surrey.ac.uk/faculty-engineering-physical-sciences) @ [University of Surrey](https://www.surrey.ac.uk/), England, United Kingdom. Before starting my Ph.D., I used to be a Junior Project Officer @ [KLIV Research group](http://iitkliv.github.io/), [IIT Kharagpur, India](http://iitkgp.ac.in). My broad area of research is the domain of *Artifical Intelligence (A.I.)*; I am specifically interested in the emerging field of Deep Learning applied mainly in (but not restricted to) Computer Vision tasks. Having a tremendous love for programming, I am also focused on writing good quality codes/softwares related to my field of study. I love to share knowledge and so decided to maintain a technical blog in this website. I am currently a part of [SketchX Lab](http://sketchx.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/), an elite group of researchers pioneering in the field of sketch analysis, led by my Ph.D. supervisor [Dr Yi-Zhe Song](https://www.surrey.ac.uk/people/yi-zhe-song) and [others](http://sketchx.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/people/). I have also been selected as an [Intel Student Ambassador](https://software.intel.com/en-us/ai-academy/ambassadors) for A.I. to serve in Europe.
