### Story version

I am an Indian national, born an brought up in [Kolkata](https://wikitravel.org/en/Kolkata), often referred to as the *City of Joy*. I finished my secondary & higher-secondary schooling in my hometown. I then appeared in [WBJEE](https://wbjeeb.nic.in/WBJEEBBoardCMS/Page/Page?PageId=1&LangId=P), a competitive exam for undergraduate studies. I secured a rank of approx. 3k and got admitted in [Institute of Engineering & Management](https://iem.edu.in/) with a concentration on Electronics & Communication Engineering. While an undergrad, I got interested in the field of Computer Vision and Machine Learning and joined [Indian Statistical Institute (ISI), Kolkata](https://www.isical.ac.in/) around 2014 as an intern and worked on several projects with two academics and published 6 papers within 3 years. I then went on to pursue Masters at [Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Kharagpur](http://iitkgp.ac.in/) where I worked on a Deep Medical Imaging project sponsored by [Intel India Pvt. Ltd](https://www.intel.in/content/www/in/en/homepage.html). I, did not however, finish my masters. I dropped out and moved to UK (around Oct. 2019) to join a Ph.D program (with full funding) at [SketchX lab](http://sketchx.ai/), University of Surrey. During my PhD, I worked on the intersection of Computer Vision, Graphics and Deep Learning under the supervision of [Dr. Yi-Zhe Song](http://personal.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Personal/Y.Song/) and others. As of March '23, I joined the Deep Learning team of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mtkresearch.com/en">MediaTek Research, Cambridge</a> as a full-time Deep Learning research scientist. My broad focus is both theoretical and applied research in Diffusion Models for computer vision. Before that, I have worked as an intern with the same team for nearly 10 months. I am expected to graduate around early-2024. In my Ph.D tenure till date, I have [published](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=x-WI_EgAAAAJ) in top conferences like NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, CVPR, SIGGRAPH and more. I was also recently recognized as a top reviewer at NeurIPS '23. More details can be found in my CV below.
