A computer vision based cost effective UI (User Interface) for Computers. The project consists of two modules - finger movement based mouse and a keyboard. A camera feed is taken from above the hand of a user in a usual position in front of the PC. It is then taken for processing using several state-of-the-art computer vision algorithms for extracting finger movements and recognizing them in order to predict the user control.
