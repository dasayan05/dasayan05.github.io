`rlx` is a Deep RL library written on top of PyTorch & built for educational and research purpose. Majority of the libraries/codebases for Deep RL are geared more towards reproduction of state-of-the-art algorithms on very specific tasks (e.g. Atari games etc.), but `rlx` is NOT. It is supposed to be more expressive and modular. Rather than making RL algorithms as black-boxes, `rlx` adopts an API that tries to expose more granular operation to the users which makes writing new algorithms easier. It is also useful for implementing task specific engineering into a known algorithm (as we know RL is very sensitive to small implementation engineerings).
