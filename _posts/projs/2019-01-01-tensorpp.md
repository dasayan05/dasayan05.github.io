`Tensor++` (pronounced as "*Tensor plus plus*") is an ambitious project of mine launched in the month of January 2019. It is launched as an Open Source project and in need of a community for development and maintenance. As we have a lack of good Deep learning (DL) frameworks *written in pure C++ from ground up and have a good user interface*, `Tensor++` is planned to be designed as a convenient alternative to PyTorch/Tensorflow written and to be used in C++ for Tensor manipulation and [Automatic Differentiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_differentiation).

It is planned to have a *Dynamic Graph* approach and highly customizable. Primary goals of `Tensor++` is:
1. Designing a tensor API similar to that of `PyTorch`
2. Clean API: "Easy to use, hard to misuse"
3. Extendability: Ability to add custom functionality or extending available ones
4. Performance: Quality code generation on variety of platforms and environments

As of now, I decided to remain the only maintainer for this project until a community is created around it and the codebase is in a mature state.
