Project `anyx` (pronounced as "anix") is a python library designed for easily producing high-quality (vector) graphics animations with ease. Although `anyx` is built with no assumption about its downstream area of application, it is mostly targeted towards scientific community for creating beautiful scientific/technical illustrations. `anyx` is created as a programmatic alternative to heavyweight and (sometimes) proprietary graphical software. Unlike low-level libraries like [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/news), `anyx` allows users to simply write a _description_ of a target scene and compile it down to the required modality (Video, Animated GIFs etc). The development of `anyx` is motivated largely by a similar project called [manim](https://github.com/3b1b/manim).
