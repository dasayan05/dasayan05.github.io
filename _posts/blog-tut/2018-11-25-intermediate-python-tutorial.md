Let me make it very clear that this tutorial is **NOT** for absolute beginners. This is for the `Python` programmers who are already familiar with the standard concepts and syntax of Python. In this tutorial, we will specifically look at three features of Python namely `Generators`, `Decorators` and `Context Managers` which, in my opinion, are not used heavily by average or below-average python programmers. In my experience, these features are lesser known to programmers whose primary purpose for using python is not to focus on the language too much but just to get their own application/algorithm working. This leads to very monotonous, imparative-style codes which, in long run, become unmaintainable.


`Python` is unarguably the most versatile and easy-to-use language ever created. Today, python enjoys a huge userbase spread accross different fields of science and engineering. The reason for such a level of popularity, at least in my opinion, is the *dynamic nature* of Python. It is almost the opposite of bare-metal languages like `C++`, which are known to be *stongly typed languages*. Python is able to achieve this *dynamicity* by the virtue of very careful and elegent design decisions made by [Guido Van Rossum](https://gvanrossum.github.io/), the creator of Python in the initial days of Python's development. At the end of this tutorial, the reader is expected to get a feel of what I mean by "dynamic nature" of Python.
