This tutorial is designed to be a low level guide for `AVR MCUs (Micro Controller Unit)`. This tutorial is targeted towards people having basic knowledge of **MCUs** and **Embedded C** programming. If not, please refer to any good AVR beginners tutorial online - there are plenty of them. Throughout the entire tutorial I will be using **Atmega32A** MCU for showing examples codes (probably not in this tutorial). In this tutorial I will rather be talking about the architecture of AVR MCUs specifically Atmega32A.

So, let's get started.

### Prerequisites :
1. Basics of Microcontrollers (Very basic, you should know at least what they are)
2. Embedded C (Actually it the standard C language with a library built on top of it)
3. Atmel Studio (According to me, the best IDE for embedded development) [not needed right now]
4. Basic knowledge of Digital Electronics
