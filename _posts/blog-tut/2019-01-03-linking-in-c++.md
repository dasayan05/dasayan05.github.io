C++ is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm programming language invented by Bjarne Stroustrup which alongwith C, forms the backbone of the industry today. The three fundamental features which make C++ special are: 

1. **Zero cost abstractions**
2. **Genetic programming**
3. **Direct mapping to hardware**
