    Being a passionate research practitioner, I love to distribute knowledge among fellow researchers and students who are interested in my fields of study/research. So, I decided to maintain a consolidated platform for knowledge distribution. I will try my best to keep at least this part of the website alive by pushing quality contents about either a particular topic of my studies or a general tutorials for beginners/intermediates. Below are the articles/tutorials that I could write when I got time. Click the one that interests you. <br>
    If you want me to write something specific that you need, just mail me @ <u>dasayan05@hotmail.com</u>
